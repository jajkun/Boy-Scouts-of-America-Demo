## --- coding_exercise1_1.js:
Write an emitter class: /* emitter = new Emitter   (); 
     // 1. Support subscribing to events. sub = emitter.subscribe('event_name', callback); sub2 = emitter.subscribe('event_name', callback2); 
     // 2. Support emitting events. // This particular example should lead to the `callback` above being invoked with `foo` and `bar` as parameters. emitter.emit('event_name', foo, bar); 
     // 3. Support unsubscribing existing subscriptions by releasing them. sub.release(); // `sub` is the reference returned by `subscribe` above */ 
     
can't have more than one subcriber. 

## --- coding_exercise2_1.js:
1) implement function 1 and function 2  and plus function will function1 + function2 will print 3
function1 will print 1 and function2 will print 2 and like function in programming function1+function2 will return 3 

## --- coding_exercise2_2.js:
Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.
Example : 
     27 -> (2*7) -> 14 -> (1*4) -> 4
     ,
     561 -> 5*6*1 -> 30 -> 3*0 -> 0
